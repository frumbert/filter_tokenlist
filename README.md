# Token List

A quick filter plugin to substitute [[list-available-tokens]] with a table of courses with their top remaining available tokens.

You probably never want to expose this to users.

Compatibility
-------------

Built on Moodle 3.8, probably works for 2.x branches too.

Installation
------------

Use the plugin installer (reccomended), or put the 'substitute' folder into your moodle filter folder.
